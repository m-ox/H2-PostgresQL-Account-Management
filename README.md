## Backstory (non-essential, feel free to skip)

It's 2023. I find out from work I'm going to a new language and I better figure that out right quick. I guess that's the career... At first I was pretty grateful, because I hear Springboot is pretty forgiving and admittedly black boxxy for noobs and I wanna hit the ground running for the whole thing. I have a little bit of experience pivoting languages at this point, so I felt I could work with that. At the very least I was looking forward to that static typing life. Javascript is too loosey goosey. Time to ashew the frontend-- It really was just time to finally dip my toes into Java land.

## This project
This Springboot "account management" API repo is a culmination of pouring over java docs, an udemy course, medium articles, and pestering Eric about design patterns. It might be un-elegant. Maybe a little code steal-y. But it works.

It features an API that supports:
- GET all employees
- GET an employee based on provided id (slug style)
- POST to create an employee
- POST to update an employee by providing an id (slug style, up can update the email, last and first name)
- DELETE to destroy an employee via id

Things it does not feature:
- tests lmao
- wow java devs really be annotation devs lmaoo

## In Conclusion
It is 2025. I have finished the Java project for the company. I am now a full fledged senior Springboot annotation dev. My review of this boilerplate project? Yo, it kinda sucks. I don't actually code like this. Who did this? Not me. Some noob lost in the stack overflow forums clearly. I might get around to updating this repo, but at least this thing has a README. B)
